###Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Multiple_linear_regression](Multiple_linear_regression.png)

-Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The intercept, the vehicle_length and the ground_clearance are the variables that statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. 

-Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
-Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
